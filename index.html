<!-- 研究方向 -->
<hr/>
<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>I am interested in flexible and intelligent control in optical/IP/5G networks. Previously I have worked on  software-defined networking (SDN) to extend flexibility and scalability in optical networks. Benefit from development experience in several SDN projects between 2014 to 2017, I got a firm grasp on academic research of multi-domain resource allocation, and software development of SDN controllers (NOX, ODL, and ONOS) and related simulators (Mininet and Link-OE). Currently, I focus on the topic that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into optical networks, including on-board AI in data plane, centralized AI in control plane, and automatic inference in application plane.</p>

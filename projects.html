				<li>SOON is a testbed to introduce AI technology into optical network to improve performance of optical network in network engineering and transmission engineering. The implementation of SOON is based on ONOS controller and TensorFlow platform. SOON has been demonstrated at European Conference on Optical Communication in Roma, which is largely the most voted project.</li>
				<li>I am <b>leader</b> of this project. I design the architecture of SOON, and implement main part of SOON.</li>

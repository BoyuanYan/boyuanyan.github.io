			<b>08/2017 – 09/2018 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Self-Optimization Optical Network (SOON) testbed (Team Leader)</b>
		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>强调是和华为，国家电网合作SOON is a testbed to introduce AI technology into optical network to improve performance of optical network in network engineering and transmission engineering. The implementation of SOON is based on ONOS controller and TensorFlow platform. SOON has been demonstrated at European Conference on Optical Communication in Roma.</li>
			<li>I design the architecture of SOON, and implement main part of SOON.</li>

		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>The objective aimed to promote the standardization process of PCEP protocol stack and Restconf protocol in IETF, and evaluate abstraction and control of traffic engineered networks (ACTN) architecture, with cooperation with Huawei, Ericsson, Spain Telefonica, China Mobile, China Unicom, Korea SK telecom, Korea ETRI, CAICT.</li>
			<li>We published an IETF standard and several IETF drafts, attended IETF 96th and 97th meetings, and won best input award. And ACTN becomes part of ONOS.</li>
			<li>I’m involved in implementation of physical optical network controller and multi-domain service coordinator, and inter-operation with other controllers developed by partners.</li>
